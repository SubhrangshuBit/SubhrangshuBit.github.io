## About Me {#aboutme}

I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student in Boston University.
I am a member of the [Kolachalama
Laboratory](https://vkola-lab.github.io) working under the supervision
of [Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/vkola/).

<p>I go by "Subh", pronounced as "Shoobh".

## Research

I mostly spend my time designing and developing machine learning models
to aid biomedical applications. My research interests fall under the
umbrella of multimodal representation learning.

However, I am still on the exploration journey <i class="fa fa-road" aria-hidden="true"></i> to find my niche. I would
be happy to talk more on anything related:

<details>
<summary>Topics of interest</summary>

* Intersection of video and language understanding.
* Are models capable of continually learning new tasks on videos?
* Can we stop training to align embeddings from different off-the-shelf foundation models?
</details>
